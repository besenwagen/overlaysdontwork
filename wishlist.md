* F80: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.4 when text-based form controls do not resize when visually rendered text is resized up to 200%
* F81: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to identifying required or error fields using color differences only
* F82: Failure of Success Criterion 3.3.2 by visually formatting a set of phone number fields but not including a text label
