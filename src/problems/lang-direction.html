<h1>Text direction &amp; Language of Parts</h1>

<p><span>كيف يؤثر الهواء الملوث على صحة أمعائك؟</span></p>

<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>The above passage of text was written in Arabic. It says &quot;How does polluted air affect the health of your bowel&quot;
    (a story headline from the BBC Arabic site, February 5, 2019). The passage's intended direction (right-to-left) and
    its language code have not been identified.
    As a result, it will not be displayed properly to visual users and will not be read properly to screenreader
    users.</p>
<p>To automatically fix this, an overlay product would need to: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Detect that the passage of text is in a different language than the identified language of the parent
        document.
    </li>
    <li>Determine which language it is</li>
    <li>Mark that passage with the correct ISO language code</li>
    <li>Determine if it is a language intended for right-to-left rendering and, if so, mark it as such</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all possible. In fact, this could even be done in the site visitor's browser. However, doing so requires
    analyzing every
    element in the DOM that holds any text in it and attempting to determine its language. </p>
