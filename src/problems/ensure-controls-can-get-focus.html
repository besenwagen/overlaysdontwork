<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>Probably one of the most prolific accessibility problems out there is the creation of custom controls that do not
    have the necessary, roles, states,
    properties, and behaviors built in.</p>

<p>The above example shows a custom checkbox. Its state is managed by JavaScript and although it correctly reacts to
    both <code>click</code> and
    <code>keydown</code> events, it does not get focus via the keyboard. This, of course, is a big problem. Users of
    screen readers and keyboard-only users
    will be unable to get focus on this control and therefore will be unable to interact with it.</p>

<p>As so many other examples have shown, an overlay product won't fix these because they won't know what the heck it is
    in the first place.</p>
