<h1>Image of Text</h1>

<div>
    <img src="images/images-of-text.jpg" alt="Infographic: The Road to Fuel Efficiency"/>
</div>

<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>This example shows an image with text inside of it. I like this example because in some cases it is actually possible
    to determine if an image
    has text in it. It is also sometimes possible to determine what the text is. Unfortunately doing so accurately is
    heavily dependent on:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The quality of the image</li>
    <li>The legibility of the font in use</li>
    <li>Having clear boundaries between the letters and the other stuff in the image</li>
    <li>Having the ability to also understand the <em>structure</em> of the content being displayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Chances are, no overlay vendor is going to have the capability to accurately fix text-in-images, as it is a huge
    hassle.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Doing so in the browser will also mean leveraging the user's CPU to do that work - something customers would
        really not want.
    </li>
    <li>A server-side process could do this, but:
        <ul>
            <li>it would become a horse race between the service and the user, as the generated alternative text would
                need to be put into place, or
            </li>
            <li>the generated text alternative could be cached by the service but it is still another AJAX call that the
                site owner probably doesn't want
            </li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Regardless of approach, the challenges of accuracy will always exist.</li>
</ul>
