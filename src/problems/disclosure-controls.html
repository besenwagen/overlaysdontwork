    <h2>More reasons why overlays suck</h2>
    <p>Overlay products cannot detect which items have events bound to them. Read the Explanation below to learn why
        that matters.</p>
</div>


<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>This one is a doozy. There's so much wrong that an overlay product will be unable to cope with. This deserves a
    list:</p>

<ol>
    <li>There's a click event bound to the
        <cod>h2</cod>
        element. Heading elements should not have events bound to them. An overlay product cannot detect this, because
        doing so requires privileged access that their script cannot have.
    </li>
    <li>The <code>p</code> element is shown and hidden by JavaScript based on clicking the heading. It does not react to
        key events.
    </li>
    <li>When the heading is clicked, the state of the control isn't conveyed properly to assistive technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's no way for an overlay product to fix these issues, primarily because there's no way to accurately detect the
    problem in the first place. The overlay will have no idea that this widget exists.</p>
