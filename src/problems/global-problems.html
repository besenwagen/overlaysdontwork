<h1>Itemized list of global problems</h1>

<p>In addition to the individual problem examples shown elsewhere, this page also has a number of global problems that
    are
    unlikely to be addressed by overlays:</p>

<h2>Disabled zoom</h2>
<p>Page zoom has been disabled. This will cause problems for anyone who wants to enlarge the content for easier viewing,
    such as users who are low-vision. Overlay products could
    fix this quite easily, but not without the risk of breaking the site's design.</p>

<h2>Minimum Width</h2>
<p>The page has been given a minimum width of 1200px. As a result, people with smaller screens or low resolution screens
    will experience horizontal scroll. Overlay products could
    fix this quite easily, but not without the risk of breaking the site's design.</p>

<h2>Disabled focus styles &amp; disabled cursor on interactive elements</h2>
<p>All interactive elements on entire examples section have been given CSS that removes focus and cursor. This is
    probably the only thing on this page that an overlay could reliably fix.</p>

<h2>Disabled text highlighting</h2>
<p>Some users choose to read portions of the page by highlighting the text. This practice can be employed by those with
    some visual impairments or those with cognitive impairments to make the text easier to read, the latter of whom may
    also activate OS features to read the highlighted text via text-to-speech software.</p>

<h2>Improper order to headings</h2>
<p>Each problem example is preceded by an <code>h1</code> element. However, within the examples, the heading levels have
    been randomized. An overlay product could possibly fix this by implementing their own custom version of the mythical
    <a href="http://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html">outline algorithm</a> but
    they'd also need to copy and re-implement the CSS stylings for those headings so as to not break the design.</p>

<h2>Links open new windows</h2>
<p>All off-domain links are set to open in new windows. These do not use <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code> (which
    could easily be fixed by an overlay) but use JavaScript for the new windows. As stated elsewhere, an overlay cannot
    fix this because it won't be able to detect the events bound to these links.</p>
