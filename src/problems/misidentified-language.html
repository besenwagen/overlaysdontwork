<h1>Misidentified Language</h1>

<p><span lang="de" dir="rtl">كيف يؤثر الهواء الملوث على صحة أمعائك؟</span></p>

<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>The above passage of text was written in Arabic. It says &quot;How does polluted air affect the health of your bowel&quot;
    (a story headline from the BBC Arabic site, February 5, 2019). The passage's language has not been identified.
    As a result, it will not be read properly to screenreader users.</p>
<p>To automatically fix this, an overlay product would need to: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Detect that the passage of text is in a different language than the identified language on its container
    </li>
    <li>Determine which language it is</li>
    <li>Mark that passage with the correct ISO language code</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all possible. In fact, this could even be done in the site visitor's browser. However, doing so requires
    analyzing every element in the DOM that holds any text in it and attempting to determine its language.</p>
