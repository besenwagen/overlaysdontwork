<p class="explanation">Explain</p>
<p>The table above uses color to indicate whether the stock value has fallen or risen using a red background color and
    green background color respectively.
    This is bad because there's no other mechanism of providing that information. This can be repaired by using a '-' or
    '+' sign. An overlay product cannot
    automatically fix this because it will have no idea what the colors mean and therefore no idea what to do to fix
    it.</p>
