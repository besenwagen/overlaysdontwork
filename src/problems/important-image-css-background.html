<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>The above example shows the use of meaningful images within the CSS. This is an accessibility problem because background images cannot be given <code>alt</code>
attributes. Although some work-arounds exist for doing so, that's rarely done. </p>
<p>Overlay products could easily detect the existence of a background image, but the overlay would have no ability to determine if the background image is meaningful
or what an appropriate text alternative would be for that image.</p>
