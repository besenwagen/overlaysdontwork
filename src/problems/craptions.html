<p class="explanation">Explanation</p>
<p>This video provides captions of very low quality. As a consequence, users who are deaf or hard-of-hearing will be
    unable to accurately
    understand the content. It is impossible for an overlay product to fix this because that would require the overlay
    product to have the
    ability to access the audio content, recognize the words, and generate its own captions - something Google itself
    cannot sufficiently do
    in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, as a bonus, this video also does not have audio description. That's another thing an overlay can't
    fix!</p>
