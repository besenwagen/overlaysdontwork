  <h2 id="explanationHeader">What this is</h2>
  <p>First, an apology for any users with disabilities. This page is purposely broken in ways that will frustrate you in
    weird and unpredictable ways. Here's why:</p>
  <p>For years, I've been warning people not to get sucked into the false promises of products that claim to magically
    make your website accessible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a
      href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2016/01/07/on-overlays-as-a-means-of-resolving-website-accessibility-issues/">&quot;On
      overlays as a means of resolving website accessibility issues&quot;</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2012/04/19/can-assistive-technology-make-a-website-accessible/">&quot;Can
      assistive technology make a website accessble?&quot;</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2015/11/13/when-the-treatment-is-worse-than-the-disease/">&quot;When the
      treatment is worse than the disease.&quot;</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html/vU-Z_LnBX64/VA2ICES_MQkJ">I'm
    not the only one with these criticisms</a>. My feelings have been echoed by many others <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1796098/1796098-83364189">including Jim Thatcher</a> a legend in
    accessibility.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, well-meaning customers are still being suckered by sales people claiming that their product &quot;automatically
    transforms the website to meet 508 and WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility standards.&quot; These claims are, in a word:
    <strong>bullshit</strong>. I've developed this page to prove this.</p>

  <p>This page is a challenge to all of those vendors: Make this page accessible by <a
    href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2018/sessions/">CSUN 2018</a> and prove it.</p>

<h6 style="font-size: 2em;">I got 99 Problems and Overlays can't find one</h6>

<section role="region" aria-labelledby="howItWorksHeader" id="howItWorks" tabindex="-1">
  <h2 id="howItWorksHeader">How it Works</h2>

  <p>This page presents a large number of examples of inaccessible code that cannot be reliably fixed by an &quot;overlay&quot;
    product. Each of the examples is provided along with an explanation of why it is a problem and why an overlay cannot
    fix it.</p>

  <p>The problems are chosen at random and presented via JavaScript. This, of course, is problem #1 which is that all of
    the content inside the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element relies on JavaScript. Then again, so do the overlays.</p>

  <p>Some overlay products need to be explicitly coded to the specific web site, which makes the overlay more effective,
    but also more brittle. Custom overlay solutions are quick to break when sites are changed during normal maintenance
    and modifications. I've taken steps to confuse attempts at custom solutions, too.</p>

  <p>Although some of these examples might seem like weird edge-cases, they are not. Every one is an example based on
    the most commonly logged issues across over 260 accessibility audits that included manual testing.</p>

  <p>Happy hunting!</p>
