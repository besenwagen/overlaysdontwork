    <h2 id="explanationHeader">What this is</h2>
    <p>First, an apology for any users with disabilities. This page is purposely broken in ways that will frustrate you
        in
        weird and unpredictable ways. Here's why:</p>
    <p>For years, I've been warning people not to get sucked into the false promises of products that claim to magically
        make your website accessible:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a
            href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2016/01/07/on-overlays-as-a-means-of-resolving-website-accessibility-issues/">&quot;On
            overlays as a means of resolving website accessibility issues&quot;</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2012/04/19/can-assistive-technology-make-a-website-accessible/">&quot;Can
            assistive technology make a website accessble?&quot;</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2015/11/13/when-the-treatment-is-worse-than-the-disease/">&quot;When the
            treatment is worse than the disease.&quot;</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><a
        href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html/vU-Z_LnBX64/VA2ICES_MQkJ">I'm
        not the only one with these criticisms</a>. My feelings have been echoed by many others <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1796098/1796098-83364189">including Jim Thatcher</a> - a legend in
        accessibility.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, well-meaning customers are still being suckered by sales people claiming that their product &quot;automatically
        transforms the website to meet 508 and WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility standards.&quot; These claims are, in a word:
        <strong>bullshit</strong>. I've developed this page to prove this.</p>

    <p>This page is a challenge to all of those vendors: Make this page accessible by <a
        href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/2018/sessions/">CSUN 2019</a> and prove it using your current product
        as deployed to customers.</p>

<section role="region" aria-labelledby="howItWorksHeader" id="howItWorks" tabindex="-1">
    <h2 id="howItWorksHeader">How it Works</h2>

    <p>This page presents a large number of examples of inaccessible code that cannot be reliably fixed by an &quot;overlay&quot;
        product. Each of the examples is provided along with an explanation of why it is a problem and why an overlay
        cannot
        fix it.</p>

    <p>The problems are chosen at random and presented via JavaScript. This, of course, is problem #1 which is that all
        of
        the content inside the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element relies on JavaScript. Then again, so do the overlays.
    </p>

    <p>Some overlay products need to be explicitly coded to the specific web site, which makes the overlay more
        effective,
        but also more brittle. Custom overlay solutions are quick to break when sites are changed during normal
        maintenance
        and modifications. I've taken steps to confuse attempts at custom solutions, too.</p>

    <p>Although some of these examples might seem like weird edge-cases, they are not. Every one of the examples below
        are based on
        the most commonly logged issues across over 260 accessibility audits that included manual testing.</p>

    <p>Happy hunting!</p>

<section class="sr-only" id="srInfo" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="srInfoHeader">
    <h2 id="srInfoHeader">Work-Arounds for Screenreader users</h2>
    <p>As I said in the <a href="#explanation">explanation</a> this page is horribly broken. I did this on purpose to
        prove a point. Please read the below carefully.</p>
    <p>When you clicked the link to get to this information, we stopped and fixed the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Wrong language identified for the content</li>
        <li>Random focus shift</li>
        <li>Takes too long to load examples</li>
        <li>Random refresh</li>
        <li>Random dialog advertisement</li>
        <li>Random heading levels</li>
        <li>Random tab order</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That said, things are still going to be a little wacky. Here's how to understand the content. Each example starts
        with a heading-level-1 element. Below that is the example of an accessibility problem that overlays cannot fix.
        When you hear the word 'Explain', what follows is the explanation of the example and why an overlay cannot fix
        it. The explanation will always have accessible markup within it so you can understand the problem</p>
