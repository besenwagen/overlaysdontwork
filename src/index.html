        <h2 id="explanationHeader">What this is</h2>
        <p>First, an apology for any users with disabilities. This page is purposely broken in ways that will frustrate
            you in weird and unpredictable ways. Here's why:</p>
        <p>For years, I've been warning people not to get sucked into the unjustified promises of &quot;overlay&quot; products that claim to
            magically make your website accessible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a
                href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2016/01/07/on-overlays-as-a-means-of-resolving-website-accessibility-issues/">&quot;On
                overlays as a means of resolving website accessibility issues&quot;</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2012/04/19/can-assistive-technology-make-a-website-accessible/">&quot;Can
                assistive technology make a website accessble?&quot;</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/2015/11/13/when-the-treatment-is-worse-than-the-disease/">&quot;When
                the
                treatment is worse than the disease.&quot;</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p><a
            href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html/vU-Z_LnBX64/VA2ICES_MQkJ">I'm
            not the only one with these criticisms</a>. My feelings have been echoed by many others <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1796098/1796098-83364189">including Jim Thatcher</a> - a legend in
            accessibility.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, well-meaning customers are still being duped by sales people claiming that their product
            &quot;automatically
            transforms the website to meet 508 and WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility standards.&quot; These claims are false.
            I've developed this page to prove this point.</p>

    </section>

    <section role="region" aria-labelledby="howItWorksHeader" id="howItWorks" tabindex="-1">
        <h2 id="howItWorksHeader">How it Works</h2>

        <p>This page presents a large number of examples of inaccessible code that cannot be reliably fixed by an &quot;overlay&quot;
            product. Each of the examples is provided along with an explanation of why it is a problem and why an
            overlay
            cannot
            fix it.</p>

        <p>Some overlay products need to be explicitly coded to the specific web site, which can make the overlay more
            effective,
            but also more brittle. Custom overlay solutions are quick to break when sites are changed during normal
            maintenance
            and modifications.</p>

        <p>Although some of these examples might seem like weird edge-cases, they are not. Every one of the examples
            below
            are based on
            the most commonly logged issues across over 260 accessibility audits that included manual testing.</p>

        <p>Happy hunting!</p>

        <h2 id="srInfoHeader">Work-Arounds for Screenreader users</h2>
        <p>As I said in the <a href="#explanation">explanation</a> this page is horribly broken. I did this on purpose
            to
            prove a point. Please read the below carefully.</p>
        <p>When you clicked the link to get to this information, we stopped and fixed the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Wrong language identified for the content</li>
            <li>Random tab order</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That said, things are still going to be a little wacky. Here's how to understand the content. This page makes use of landmark roles.
            The examples are within the 'main' landmark. Each example
            starts
            with a heading-level-1 element. Below that is the example of an accessibility problem that overlays cannot
            fix.
            When you hear the word 'Explain', what follows is the explanation of the example and why an overlay cannot
            fix
            it. The explanation will always have accessible markup within it so you can understand the problem.</p>
